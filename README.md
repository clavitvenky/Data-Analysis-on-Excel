# Industry Skills🏛️
🔹Analyzed sales data to assess Customer performance, Market performance against targets, Top 10 products, Division-level reports, Top and   Bottom 5 products by Quantity, as well as New products and the Top 5 
  Markets.

🔹Analyzed financial metrics such as Net Sales, COGS (Cost of Goods Sold), Gross Margin, and GM% (Gross Margin Percentage) on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis for the fiscal year.

🔹P&L Statements include several critical metrics, such as **Net Sales**, **Cost of Goods sold (COGS),** **Gross Margin**, **Gross Margin %** etc. These Metric Evaluate a Company’s financial performance, 
  Profitability, and Pricing tactics.
  
🔹**Net Sales:** It refers to the total revenue generated from sales transactions after deducting any returns, discounts, and allowances.

🔹**Cost of Goods sold (COGS):** It refers to the direct costs attributable to the production of the goods or services sold by the company. 
  These costs typically include expenses such as: cost of raw materials, cost of labor, Indirect costs associated with production, such as utilities, depreciation of equipment, and factory rent etc.

🔹**Gross Margin:** It's the percentage of revenue (from net sales) that the company retains after accounting for the direct costs (COGS) associated with making or acquiring its products.

  It is calculated as the difference between net sales (total revenue from sales after deductions for returns, discounts, and allowances) and the cost of goods sold (COGS).
  
        Gross Margin=Net sales -COGS
        GM%=(GM/ Net sales) * 100
        
  A higher gross margin generally indicates that the company is effectively managing its production costs relative to the price it charges for its products.
